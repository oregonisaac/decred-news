## Development

# Governance of the Decred project subsidy through Politeia
As everyone who has followed the Decred project knows one of the most powerful novel features is consensus change governance.  In the last two and a half years consensus changes have been decentralized and consensus based allowing quick and interuption free upgrades to the Decred network.
This month the Decred project took another huge step both for Decred and community by launching Politeia - a combination of multiple open source toolsets developed for the Decred ecosystem which utilize the same onchain governance system and a chain anchored offchain proposal system to decentralize decisions about spending from the Decred treasury.
The Decred project is self-funded through 10% of the block reward which has been spent very conservatively (allowing for a 580k DCR surplus).  While some have criticised this choice seeing the impact of large marketing and market maker spending on other projects others in the community applaud this choice as a prudent ethical decision until decentralized decision making of the fund was possible.
That historical moment arrived on Oct 15 when Politeia launched live on mainnet.

@jy-p noted that Politeia's great power can be used to improve Decred, but also lead to problems if used unwisely. To inform stakeholders, he shared his experiences as a custodian of the treasury. The post contains many insights and long term vision and is highly recommended for stakeholders to read.

Second highlight is Decrediton 1.3.1 release https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.3.1 {unroll key features} {note politeiavoter tool}

Translations are challenging. In the past there was an attempt to do community translations and it had a lot of problems that led to a decision to use professional service. But that doesn't guarantee accurate translations that don't raise eyebrows of native speakers. Verifying translations to a language you don't speak is challenging. Therefore anyone is welcome to let the team know about poor quality translations.

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia):

Received dozens of issue reports after launch.

* Ability to lock accounts that are abusing the system or for security reasons https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/537
* {worth?} ability to revoke prop vote auth https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/655

Up next is polishing and scaling Politeia, as well as developing a smart contract for the Treasury.

## Governance

We had a total of {4} proposals in Politeia this month. All of them are in the pre-voting stage.

1. @Richard-Red put forth a proposal on October 16, 2018 titled ["Decred Open Source Research"](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c68bb790ba0843980bb9695de4628995e75e0d1f36c992951db49eca7b3b4bcd) it aims to seek funding for opensource research onto cryptocurrency and will involve multiple contributors. He is currently requesting for 10000 USD as an initial budget for a few months.

{markets overview: USD and BTC prices, highs and lows, interesting events, interesting analysis}

On Oct 15 a huge dump of USDT caused it to drop below $0.8 on some exchanges, and a corresponding spike of BTC/USDT to 7700. On Poloniex, panic spikes on USDT/USDC reached 0.59. This happened just a few hours after a (fake) rumor of Binance delisting USDT circulated on Twitter.
