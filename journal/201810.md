# {DRAFT} Decred Journal – October 2018

![{alt text}](../img/{file.jpg} "{hover text}")

Big news of the month is the historical moment: Politeia mainnet launch. Congratulations to everyone and thanks to Politeia team for the countless hours of work.

@jy-p noted that Politeia's great power can be used to improve Decred, but also lead to problems if used unwisely. To inform stakeholders, he shared his experiences as a custodian of the [Decred Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx). The [blog post](https://blog.decred.org/2018/10/15/Politeia-in-Production/) is highly recommended for stakeholders for all the insights and long it contains.

New software version 1.3.1 was released to allow everyone to participate in Politeia. It adds Governance page to Decredition for GUI users, and introduces a new `politeiavoter` tool for CLI users. Get the downloads on [GitHub](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.3.1) and don't forget to [verify signatures](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/blob/v1.3.1/README.md#verifying-binaries).

## Development

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd):

* Another big change towards multipeer downloads entered testing. It [optimizes](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1500) chain reorganization logic for the typical case and makes reorganizations use less memory.
* Regression network (regnet) was [resurrected](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1480) and several unit tests were [migrated](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1481) to it. This allowed to separate concerns and [optimize](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1482) simnet setup.
* [This change](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1476) simplifies setting up dcrd on a separate machine.
* New [getblockchaininfo](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1479) RPC provides useful chain-related information that was previously unavailable.
* Go Report Card was added to README and as of writing it is [showing](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/decred/dcrd) A+ rating for the project.
* Various RPC, testing and infrastructure improvements.

A lot of mining-related improvements are [in the pipeline](https://matrix.to/#/!NNzHoaSdnsbZDQOXJr:decred.org/$154003890434385mrGTu:decred.org).

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet): bug fixes.

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton): [Version 1.3.1](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.3.1) reveals SPV and Politeia functionality to all users. It also adds first batch of translations that include French, Spanish, German, Japanese and Chinese (simplified). If you are a long standing community member and notice any incorrect translations you can open an issue on github or contact the team on the slack/matrix chat platforms. To ensure high quality translations, some trust with the project is currently required to submit translation issues. At the same time, the procedures to allow input from more users is being formalized.

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia):

* Multiple bug fixes and UI improvements.
* [Ability](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/538) for admins to specify quorum, pass threshold and vote duration.
* [Ability](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/537) to lock accounts that are abusing the system or for security reasons.
* [Ability](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/655) to revoke proposal vote authorization.
* Many community members joined testing and submitted dozens of issue reports after launch.

Up next is adding notifications and other missing features. Longer term plan is to scale Politeia and develop smart contracts for the Treasury.

[Android](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid): design upgrades, bugfixes and stability improvements.

[iOS](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios): design upgrades and bugfixes.

[dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata):

* Lots of work to speed up initial sync ([751](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/751), [754](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/754), [752](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/752)).
* Insight API [documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/719).
* Work ongoing for [new home page](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/718) design.
* [Disapproved Blocks](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/733) page is in development.

Trezor: Decred support was merged into Model T firmware repository. Decrediton integration can be merged after the next firmware release. This is all for normal transactions. Buying tickets requires more work and changes to dcrwallet.

[Ticket splitting](https://github.com/matheusd/dcr-split-ticket-matcher): v0.6.2 released, the downloads and release notes are [on GitHub](https://github.com/matheusd/dcr-split-ticket-matcher/releases/tag/v0.6.2). On the master branch OpenBSD support was added among a few internal improvements.

[docs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs): updated relevant documentation for the 1.3.1 release, added new [Decrediton troubleshooting](https://docs.decred.org/getting-started/user-guides/decrediton-troubleshooting/) page, [upgrade](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/601) of mkdocs and material theme allowed to simplify things.

Politeia documentation is nearing completion, SPV documentation is planned next.

[decred.org](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb): [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/issues/370) outdated compare page that caused some controversy, code cleanup, updated press and exchanges. 5 contractors added and 1 removed.

[Design](https://github.com/decred/dcrdesign/releases): EETER updated Decred logo for better performance on digital screens. Check this [blog post](https://medium.com/decred/dcr-logo-performance-update-f12f94a7a33e) with details and comparison to old logo.

Did you know there are several [Decred packages](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?O=0&K=decred) in Arch User Repository?

There was a small [interruption](https://matrix.to/#/!VFRvyndKpzcLrVslQD:decred.org/$154021525435657VDmQn:decred.org) on GitHub that had a minor impact on work, but the developers are keeping an eye on GitHub.

Dev activity stats for October: 310 active PRs, 297 master commits, 65K added and 22K deleted lines spread across 8 repositories. Contributions came from 4-9 developers per repository. ([chart]({}))

## Governance

We had a total of {6} proposals in Politeia in October.

1. @Richard-Red put forth a proposal on October 16, 2018 titled ["Decred Open Source Research"](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c68bb790ba0843980bb9695de4628995e75e0d1f36c992951db49eca7b3b4bcd) it aims to seek funding for opensource research onto cryptocurrency and will involve multiple contributors. He is currently requesting for 10000 USD as an initial budget for a few months.

Current Status: Proposal voting active

2. @Richard-Red opened a proposal titled ["Change language: PoS Mining to PoS Voting, Stakepool to Voting Service Provider"](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/522652954ea7998f3fca95b9c4ca8907820eb785877dcf7fba92307131818c75).

The proposal goes into detail on a method to handle adding new contractors, removal of contractors, contractor disputes and resolution. He suggested that it be based on existing contractors "voting".

On Oct 15 a huge dump of USDT caused it to drop below $0.8 on some exchanges, and a corresponding spike of BTC/USDT to 7700. On Poloniex, panic spikes on USDT/USDC reached 0.59. This happened just a few hours after a (fake) rumor of Binance delisting USDT circulated on Twitter.

A new [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02466), signed by researchers from from Princeton University and Florida International University, suggests that Bitcoin can be heavily influenced by China. The paper was not peer reviewed yet. The paper titled "An Analysis of Chinese Influence on Bitcoin" was twisted by the [media](https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/10/08/china-means-intent-destroy-bitcoin/) as "China has the power to destroy Bitcoin". https://mashable.com/article/bitcoin-china-destroy/

SIA Project Hardfork and ASIC Relevant ASIC Research

Although there is no direct relationship between the SIA Project and Decred Project discussions about the SIA Project decision to perform a hardfork as an attempt to ensure ROI on their self-funded ASIC project (Obelisk) have indirectly impacted the Decred community because Obelisk also made one of the 14 currently available Decred ASICs.

David Vorick, Lead Developer at Nebulous of the SIA Project, began back in May of this year to share in earnest some troubling findings that he and his team had made working on an ASIC project in his SIA blog post [The State of Cryptocurrency Mining] (https://blog.sia.tech/the-state-of-cryptocurrency-mining-538004a37f9b).  In his research he found that ASIC Resistance is inherently flawed for a couple of reasons.  The most obvious is that the risk loss of capital investment on ASIC miners as a result of a hardfork is externalized by the ASIC manufacturer due to an extremely fast sales cycle (often claiming over 200% ROI within 24 hours of ASIC sales announcement).  That means the end customers who purchase the ASIC machines would be the ones who are at risk on projects attempting any form of ASIC resistance where there is an ASIC manufacturer.  The second is a misconception about ASIC hardware and the level of flexibility possible in design.  They found that while projects can attempt to hardfork to resist ASIC manufacturing the ASIC manufactures can design hardfork resistance into their ASICs.  They also found evidence that ASIC manufacturers like Halong and Bitmain have premined large quantities of PoW rewards (including Halong using their Decred miners prior to shipping) and saw this as a what they call a "drive-by attack" on the project.

In an attempt to side-step these challenges and their impact on the SIA sponsored Obelisk ASIC project, this month SIA took the bold and controversial step of utilizing a specialized hardfork to prevent all ASICs except the Obelisk ASIC from mining SIA.  They stated the following reasons for this decision in a [FAQ on the SIA blog] (https://blog.sia.tech/sia-fork-faqs-c6b3e0e73ce0):
A) A hardfork that eliminated all ASICs would make SIA vulnerable to 51% attacks that the projects attempting ASIC resistance are currently vulnerable to.
B) No hardfork would mean that earnest members of the community would lose money because of companies who would “harm the network”.
Additional detail can be found in [October's SIA blog post from David Vorick] (https://blog.sia.tech/sia-proof-of-work-reset-24b5ec439625).

This fork was made possible because “Obelisk incorporated a secret extra circuit into the mining chip. By manufacturing their ASIC at great expense with this secret extra circuit, Nebulous could hard fork the coin to ensure that third party miners would be bricked.”

Not all of the community was happy with the decision to fork and because SIA does not have a measurable system of governance it is unclear what percentage of the community or stakeholders supported the decision.  SiaClassic, similar to Ethereum Classic after the DAO fork, will be supported by the newly formed SiaClassic Foundation and Sia Prime organization.

On October 31st the hardfork was initiated as planned and causing a delay at 178,999 for hours because, as Vorick wrote in a community forum that evening, an error in the code meant that miners "will need to mine at least one block at full difficulty before the adjustment kicks in. This may take anywhere from 6 to 48 hours."  At 6AM EST the following morning the next block was found, difficulty reset, and the block find time returned to 10 minute averages.
