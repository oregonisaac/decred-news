{BCH forks
* Bitcoin Cash, born as a solution to disagreement with Bitcoin, is splitting into 2 chains (correct?). SV = Satoshi's Vision? Again?
* (does the community split or is it a horror story by the media?)
* explain 1) why they are forking, 2) vision and tech behind SV and ABC, 3) people, companies and capital behind both
* what has Cobra to do with it?

* Poloniex [allowed](https://poloniex.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/1000270700-update-on-the-upcoming-bitcoin-cash-hard-fork) users to trade betwen both possible outcomes of the Bitcoin Cash fork. This led to the presence of _three_ tokens on the exchange: BCH, BCHABC nad BCHSV, with the latter two being 90% cheaper than BCH. Forks just keep spawning when you don't have a formal process to resolve disputes.
* It appears some forces are tearing apart Bitcoin Cash. Whatever they are, let us keep Decred resistant to them.

Alternative way do resolve disputes: attack wrong chains

> @andy_bromberg and @msantoriESQ discuss why ICOs are down 90% since the winter, why airdrops could be a better than ICOs for seeding usage on networks, whether or not they're legal and which wallets to target.

Regular security reminder: SMS, and relying on mobile operators in general, is bad choice for 2FA. Good to see lawsuits [like this](https://www.coindesk.com/victims-sue-att-t-mobile-over-sim-swap-crypto-hacks/) starting but they won't get your coins back. Speaking even more generally, most smartphones have a [baseband chip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseband_processor) and other proprietary parts that nobody really knows what they are doing or how vulnerable they are. Keep your coins safe.
